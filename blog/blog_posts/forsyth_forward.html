Tucked away in the beautiful forests and lakes of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Forsyth Township — home to the communities of Gwinn, K.I. Sawyer, and Little Lake — is experiencing a renewed sense of purpose and connection. At the center of that momentum is <strong><a href="https://www.forsythforward.org/" target="_blank">Forsyth Forward</a></strong>, a revitalized organization combining the strengths of a chamber of commerce, visitors bureau, and community development hub.
</p>

<p>
Forsyth Forward’s mission is simple: help local residents, businesses, and visitors thrive. And the results are already starting to show.
</p>

<h2>What Forsyth Forward Brings to the Community</h2>

<h3>Supporting Local Business & Economic Growth</h3>
<p>
Forsyth Forward offers tools and support to strengthen the local economy. Through its business directory, networking events, and flexible membership program, the organization provides visibility and community support for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small businesses</li>
  <li>Nonprofits</li>
  <li>Local entrepreneurs</li>
  <li>Residents invested in community development</li>
</ul>

<p>
Membership is intentionally accessible — <strong>$250 for businesses</strong>, <strong>$150 for nonprofits</strong>, and <strong>$50 for residents</strong> — ensuring that anyone who wants to be involved can be.
</p>

<h3>Investing in Community Projects & Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
Forsyth Forward is also focused on tangible improvements throughout the township. A recent example is the installation of <strong>free high-speed Wi-Fi at Peter Nordeen Park in downtown Gwinn</strong>, enhancing access for families, vendors, and community events.
</p>

<p>
Projects like these help make public spaces more welcoming, connected, and functional.
</p>

<h3>Promoting Tourism & Recreation</h3>
<p>
With its abundant lakes, vast forests, and quiet natural beauty, Forsyth Township is an ideal destination for outdoor recreation. Forsyth Forward highlights those assets — from trails to local shops — to support <strong>sustainable tourism</strong> and encourage more people to experience the area’s charm.
</p>

<p>
Whether you enjoy fishing, hiking, snowmobiling, or simply the warmth of small-town hospitality, the township is becoming an increasingly appealing place to visit or call home.
</p>

<h3>Strengthening Community Engagement</h3>
<p>
For nearly a decade, the local chamber of commerce had been inactive. Forsyth Forward stepped in to fill the gap, reconnecting residents, businesses, schools, nonprofits, and civic groups through a unified platform focused on collaboration and community leadership.
</p>

<p>
The result is a stronger, more connected Forsyth Township.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What This Means for Residents & Visitors</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Local businesses have more opportunities to grow and connect.</li>
  <li>Community spaces are becoming more accessible and enjoyable.</li>
  <li>Visitors have more reasons to explore the area’s outdoor recreation and natural beauty.</li>
  <li>Residents have a meaningful voice in shaping the community’s future.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Forsyth Forward encourages volunteerism, shared leadership, and community pride, helping people feel rooted and empowered.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Looking Ahead: A New Hub for Community Growth</h2>

<p>
With the grand opening of its new office in Gwinn in late 2025, Forsyth Forward is cementing its role as a central space for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Community gatherings</li>
  <li>Tourism support</li>
  <li>Business development</li>
  <li>Local project coordination</li>
</ul>

<p>
Their vision is ambitious yet grounded: a <strong>connected, inclusive, and vibrant Forsyth Township</strong> where people of all backgrounds can thrive together.
</p>

<p>
Whether you’re a lifelong resident, a new business owner, or simply passing through, Forsyth Forward is building a community where everyone has a place in the story.
