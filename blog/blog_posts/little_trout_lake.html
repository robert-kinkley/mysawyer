								<h3>Envisioning a New Community Space</h3>

<p>
The transformation began in June 2023, when the Marquette County Planning Division submitted a grant application to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Spark Grant program. By December 2023, the project was awarded nearly $1 million, providing full funding to revitalize Little Trout Lake Park and support accessibility, safety, and recreation upgrades. 
</p>

<p>
In early 2024, Northern Design Works was contracted to guide planning and design. Throughout that year, the project team conducted site analyses, developed plans, and coordinated removal of blighted structures and an unsafe bridge over Silver Lead Creek. These changes opened up the landscape and prepared the site for new amenities and trail connections.
</p>

<h3>Progress Through 2025</h3>

<p>
The project entered a new phase in spring 2025, when construction bids opened and MJ VanDamme Trucking, Inc. was awarded the contract for the first phase of the Greenway. On June 24, 2025, the county announced that construction had officially begun.
</p>

<p>
Work is now underway on the first major trail segment along Scorpion Street, linking the local elementary school directly to Little Trout Lake Park. Simultaneously, the park itself is undergoing significant upgrades, including new pathways, a pavilion, accessible routes, space for community events, and improved infrastructure. The park remains closed during active construction for safety reasons.
</p>

<h3>Community Engagement</h3>

<p>
In October 2025, approximately two dozen volunteers gathered for a community cleanup along Silver Lead Creek. Participants removed debris from the creek and nearby areas, marking one of the first community-led activities within the developing greenway corridor. The cleanup also enhanced stream health and prepared the area for future restoration efforts.
</p>

<h3>Why This Work Matters</h3>

<p>
The Silver Lead Creek Greenway and Little Trout Lake Park projects offer benefits that extend far beyond physical improvements. The new trail system will provide safe, walkable, and bikeable connections between neighborhoods, the school, and recreational areas—an important asset in rural communities. 
</p>

<p>
The revitalized park will serve as a central gathering point, with recreational amenities, social spaces, family-friendly features, and infrastructure designed to support community wellness. Environmental stewardship is also a key focus: restoring streamside habitat and integrating recreation with natural features ensures that area resources are preserved while becoming more accessible.
</p>

<p>
Together, these projects represent long-term investment in community identity, well-being, and sustainability—a coordinated effort supported by grant funding, county planning, and volunteer involvement.
</p>
