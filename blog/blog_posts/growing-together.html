								<h3>How It Started</h3>

<p>
The origins of LGKI trace back to the early pandemic years, when widespread disruptions made access to fresh food even more difficult for many residents. Founder Jordan Russell, responding to these challenges, began supplying garden beds to local families in 2021. What started as a small gesture quickly became a broader mission: to create a permanent community garden open to all.
</p>

<p>
By 2022, LGKI secured a dedicated parcel of land through an agreement with county officials. The planned garden—located at the corner of Scorpion and Trailer-Park Street—was envisioned as a welcoming space featuring raised beds, shaded seating, and even a children’s sandbox. From the beginning, the goal was to build not just a garden, but a shared gathering place for neighbors and families.
</p>

<h3>What the Garden Offers</h3>

<p>
<strong>Access to fresh produce:</strong> Local garden plots provide families with nearby options for fresh vegetables, a valuable resource in a rural area where grocery access is limited. LGKI also partners with health-service providers to support community nutrition programs.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Workshops and learning opportunities:</strong> With the help of educators and extension staff, the garden hosts “garden chats” and hands-on workshops covering planting, harvesting, soil care, and seed-saving. These sessions equip residents with skills to grow food either at home or in shared garden beds.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Community building:</strong> The garden serves as a relaxed, welcoming environment for neighbors to meet, children to play, and families to learn together. Features like seating areas and a sandbox reflect LGKI’s focus on making the space family-friendly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Year-round possibilities:</strong> Because of the region’s short growing season, LGKI also promotes the use of vertical tower gardens and other indoor growing methods, helping residents cultivate herbs and vegetables during colder months.
</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>

<p>
For many households in K.I. Sawyer, the community garden represents more than a hobby. It provides a pathway to healthy, affordable food in an area where access can be limited. By reducing reliance on distant grocery options and promoting local food production, LGKI strengthens food security and supports overall community well-being.
</p>

<p>
The garden also nurtures connection. In a community shaped by its past—from military base to civilian neighborhood—this shared green space offers a place for residents to gather, learn, and build relationships. It is a living symbol of collaboration and resilience.
</p>

<h3>How to Get Involved</h3>

<p>
Residents interested in participating can reach out to LGKI through their online contact information or social media presence. Volunteers are welcome to help with building beds, planting, watering, and assisting with workshops. Seasonal “garden-chat” sessions provide additional chances to learn and connect.
</p>

<p>
Those who prefer to grow food at home are encouraged to try container gardening, raised beds, or indoor tower gardens—accessible options that can supplement household food supplies throughout the year.
</p>

<h3>A Growing Sign of Community</h3>

<p>
The Let’s Grow KI Community Garden continues to evolve as a symbol of hope and local strength. In a community where fresh produce once felt out of reach, neighbors now share a space where they can cultivate food, knowledge, and connection. It is a place where growth happens in many forms—and where the community moves forward, together.
